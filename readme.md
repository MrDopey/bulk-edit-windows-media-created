# Intro

Running [handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) on videos that are then uploaded to google photos, 
loses its place in the timeline. You need to set a custom attribute on the file called 
'Media created' to have it be placed there correctly

This script applies this bulk change based on the file name (format generated by my phone)
or by reading in the modified time of the original file

Tip: Remember to un-sync the original file from your phone, or it will be re-uploaded again
